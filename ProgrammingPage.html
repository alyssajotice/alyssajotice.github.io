              <p> During the summer of 2019, I interned at Capital One Financial in their Technical Development Program Internship in McLean Virginia. I was placed on a team that worked on a customer notification platform. I was given ownership of my own microservice to help expand the functionality of the platform. The goal of the service was to allow a segment of customers to be sent a notification email. </p>

            <p> I was in charge of designing and building the back end of the project, while another intern built out the front end. My project was a Java-Maven-Spring application that pulled segment data from AWS S3. The file taken from AWS was then processed, encrypted/encoded, and an API was called for each piece of data. I used the Cassandra NoSQL database to get template information from the front end. I designed my own error reporting method and kept usage statistics and reports that were sent via AWS SNS and uploaded to S3.  </p>

            <p> My project had a high business value, and the goal of the entire summer was to put it into production by the end of my internship. I had never seen real production testing, and I got to put my code through local, system, integration, and performance testing. I learned how code is configured for these different environments and used a Jenkins job to do builds. I wrote a release plan and got to run point on the release. Pretty much every single technology used in the project was something I had never seen before, and I gained invaluable experience from doing the end to end production of a real product used by the company. This was the greatest learning experience of my career thus far and I am looking forward to using my skills for my future career. </p>

            <p> During fall 2018, I took the iOS Application Development elective for my major. I learned a lot about Swift, and got to do a Capstone project for the class. My roommate suggested a coloring app for the iPad, and I decided to go with the idea. I created a children-focused app that allows the user to color different images.</p>

            <p>Swift has been my favorite elective so far, so I was really passionate about my project and wanted to add a lot of features that would allow me to learn as much as possible about Swift. I included a tutorial, free draw, graded color by number, save image, pair coloring with another device, and different images to color. </p>

            <p>I wanted the UI to be very pleasant, so I really focused on design. To see screenshots, check out my blog post about the project<a href = "BlogEntryColorMePretty.html" > here</a>!</p>

            <p> During the summer of 2018, I interned at JP Morgan Chase and Co. in their Software Engineering Intern program. Over ten weeks, I got firsthand experience seeing how technology is developed, tested, and deployed on a massive scale. I learned about the differences between developing software in a corporate environment versus a personal environment.</p>

            <p>One of the greatest takeaways from the summer was the knowledge of how Agile works. I was placed on a sprint team with three other interns, and we operated as a fully functioning scrum team. We planned our own sprints, did backlog refinement, sprint retrospectives, and daily standups. Â I learned a lot about the differences between Agile and Waterfall and the advantages and disadvantages of each.</p>

            <p>For my project, my team worked with an internal JPMC team to create a website to centralize information needed from the team. The work I did made it easier for developers and other business analysts to find the information that they need about the health of different applications and testing environments.</p>

            <p> One of the classes I took during my freshman year was a class about musical synthesizer programming, using the programming language SuperCollider. The class gave me a lot of creative freedom to make whatever I desired for the final project. I used a Korg NanoKontroll 2 and a MIDI keyboard to build and program a sound board with changeable synthesizers.</p>
         
            <p>The NanoKontroll 2 board had nine control sections that input MIDI data to the computer, so I programmed each one to play a different synth and control specific characteristics of that synth. This project was really enjoyable for me becaue I got to combine two things that interest me, music and programming!

          <p>During the spring of my junior year, I took CMPSC 431W at Penn State, which is the Database Management Systems class. It counts as the âwriting across the curriculumâ capstone class for computer science majors. The semester was spent learning about DBMSs in class and implementing a full stack web application with a database. Since this class was writing intensive, three reports were completed over the course of the semester to outline the research, creation, and implementation of the application.</p>

          <p>My team and I built a crowd-sourced application that allowed users to post about events happening around campus. The events populated on a map based on the users location. The feed of events was algorithmically sorted based on location, voting, and tags.</p>

          <p>Overall, I learned so much about databases during the project and became really interested in doing my thesis about a topic related to database management systems. I liked learning about concurrency control, serializability, and relational algebra. I am especially interested in query optimizers.You can read more about how I executed this project in the blog post, which is <a href = "BlogEntryNearby.html" > here</a>!</p>

            <p>This website is one of the projects I worked on throughout the summer after my freshman year of college. Before creating this portfolio, I had never done any type of web development. Throughout the project, I learned skills using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I also learned how to deploy a website and obtain a domain name.</p>
         
            <p>I created this website so that I would have an appropriate place to display my skills, resume, extracurricular activies, and programming projects. I made another version of this website for a class using Wix, but wanted to code it myself to learn about web development. I also made a blog post outlining the creation of this site, which you can read  <a href = "BlogEntryPortfolio.html" > here</a>!</p>
