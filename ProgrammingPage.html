              <p> During the summer of 2019, I interned at Capital One Financial in their Technical Development Program Internship in McLean Virginia. I was placed on a team that worked on a customer notification platform. I was given ownership of my own microservice to help expand the functionality of the platform. The goal of the service was to allow a segment of customers to be sent a notification email. </p>

            <p> I was in charge of designing and building the back end of the project, while another intern built out the front end. My project was a Java-Maven-Spring application that pulled segment data from AWS S3. The file taken from AWS was then processed, encrypted/encoded, and an API was called for each piece of data. I used the Cassandra NoSQL database to get template information from the front end. I designed my own error reporting method and kept usage statistics and reports that were sent via AWS SNS and uploaded to S3.  </p>

            <p> My project had a high business value, and the goal of the entire summer was to put it into production by the end of my internship. I had never seen real production testing, and I got to put my code through local, system, integration, and performance testing. I learned how code is configured for these different environments and used a Jenkins job to do builds. I wrote a release plan and got to run point on the release. Pretty much every single technology used in the project was something I had never seen before, and I gained invaluable experience from doing the end to end production of a real product used by the company. This was the greatest learning experience of my career thus far and I am looking forward to using my skills for my future career. </p>

            <p> During fall 2018, I took the iOS Application Development elective for my major. I learned a lot about Swift, and got to do a Capstone project for the class. My roommate suggested a coloring app for the iPad, and I decided to go with the idea. I created a children-focused app that allows the user to color different images.</p>

            <p>Swift has been my favorite elective so far, so I was really passionate about my project and wanted to add a lot of features that would allow me to learn as much as possible about Swift. I included a tutorial, free draw, graded color by number, save image, pair coloring with another device, and different images to color. </p>

            <p>I wanted the UI to be very pleasant, so I really focused on design. To see screenshots, check out my blog post about the project<a href = "BlogEntryColorMePretty.html" > here</a>!</p>

            <p> During the summer of 2018, I interned at JP Morgan Chase and Co. in their Software Engineering Intern program. Over ten weeks, I got firsthand experience seeing how technology is developed, tested, and deployed on a massive scale. I learned about the differences between developing software in a corporate environment versus a personal environment.</p>

            <p>One of the greatest takeaways from the summer was the knowledge of how Agile works. I was placed on a sprint team with three other interns, and we operated as a fully functioning scrum team. We planned our own sprints, did backlog refinement, sprint retrospectives, and daily standups.  I learned a lot about the differences between Agile and Waterfall and the advantages and disadvantages of each.</p>

            <p>For my project, my team worked with an internal JPMC team to create a website to centralize information needed from the team. The work I did made it easier for developers and other business analysts to find the information that they need about the health of different applications and testing environments.</p>

            <p> One of the classes I took during my freshman year was a class about musical synthesizer programming, using the programming language SuperCollider. The class gave me a lot of creative freedom to make whatever I desired for the final project. I used a Korg NanoKontroll 2 and a MIDI keyboard to build and program a sound board with changeable synthesizers.</p>
         
            <p>The NanoKontroll 2 board had nine control sections that input MIDI data to the computer, so I programmed each one to play a different synth and control specific characteristics of that synth. This project was really enjoyable for me becaue I got to combine two things that interest me, music and programming!

          <p>During the spring of my junior year, I took CMPSC 431W at Penn State, which is the Database Management Systems class. It counts as the “writing across the curriculum” capstone class for computer science majors. The semester was spent learning about DBMSs in class and implementing a full stack web application with a database. Since this class was writing intensive, three reports were completed over the course of the semester to outline the research, creation, and implementation of the application.</p>

          <p>My team and I built a crowd-sourced application that allowed users to post about events happening around campus. The events populated on a map based on the users location. The feed of events was algorithmically sorted based on location, voting, and tags.</p>

          <p>Overall, I learned so much about databases during the project and became really interested in doing my thesis about a topic related to database management systems. I liked learning about concurrency control, serializability, and relational algebra. I am especially interested in query optimizers.You can read more about how I executed this project in the blog post, which is <a href = "BlogEntryNearby.html" > here</a>!</p>

            <p>This website is one of the projects I worked on throughout the summer after my freshman year of college. Before creating this portfolio, I had never done any type of web development. Throughout the project, I learned skills using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I also learned how to deploy a website and obtain a domain name.</p>
         
            <p>I created this website so that I would have an appropriate place to display my skills, resume, extracurricular activies, and programming projects. I made another version of this website for a class using Wix, but wanted to code it myself to learn about web development. I also made a blog post outlining the creation of this site, which you can read  <a href = "BlogEntryPortfolio.html" > here</a>!</p>
