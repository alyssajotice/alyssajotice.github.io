              <h3>The Idea</h3>

              <p>

                  For my CMPSC 431W class at Penn State, me and a team of four other developers were tasked with coming up with an idea for a full stack web application that used a database. Living on a college campus, we noticed that there are so many ways that event organizers try to spread info about things going on around campus. We came up with the idea for Nearby, which is a crowd-sourced way for people to post about the events that are going on around campus as they see them. The basic idea was that people would be able to post where the event was with a description and timing info, then other users could upvote or add comments about how the event was.

              <h3>The ER Diagram</h3>

              <p>

                The first part of any database design project is making an entity-relationship diagram about the issue. This diagram would outline the tables needed in the database and how our different entities would interact with each other. As you can see in the pictures, there was a lot of different ways in which our features interacted. Through the revision process, I learned about how important a solid ER diagram is in order to successfully implement a database.

              </p>
             <h3>The Tech Stack</h3>

              <p>

                  After the ER diagram was complete, the team had to decide on a tech stack. Through this process,Â  I learned a lot about the different options for open-source front end, back end, and database technologies. For the front end, we ended up selecting Angular over React because it has fully featured framework, built in templates, and full mode-view-controller. For the back-end, we used Django over Flask because it has built in ORM and authentication. For the database, we used PostgreSQL over MySQL because it was ACID compliant, had full search text capabilities, and was easily integrable with Django.

              </center>

              </p>



              <h3>Implementation</h3>

              <p>

                  The next step in the project was implementation. I worked with another team member on the backend with Django. I had never done web application development before, so I learned a lot about how Django worked. I started by doing the <a href = "https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/intro/tutorial01/ " target="blank" >Django Tutorial.</a> I worked on creating models for each of the entities in the ER diagram so that it would easily integrate with the PostgreSQL database. I also helped to build serializers that would help convert the ER models into easily parsed and manipulated Python objects. Designing the backend logically and methodically allowed the rest of the project to run smoothly. Below are screenshots from the finished user-facing frontend.

               <h3>The Report</h3>

              <p>
                Since this was the writing intensive class, the last part of the project was the report. Every step of the process was detailed in a 150-page report about Nearby. Through this task, I learned a lot about writing proper technical documentation. Also, a presentation was given to "investers" to try to pitch the idea and minimum viable product. Throughout development, additional features were assessed and investigated to include in this part of the presentation. Overall, I learned a lot from creating my first full-stack web application and gained an appreciation for databases. The code for this project can be found <a href = "https://github.com/bsosnader/nearby-frontend " target="blank" >here</a> and <a href = "https://github.com/michaelRoos/nearby-api " target="blank" >here</a>.
