              For one of my classes during freshman year, I had to make a personal portfolio website. At the time, I didn't know anything about web development, so I made my portfolio website using the Wix website maker. The portfolio turned out really nice, but I thought that coding a new website by myself would help me to develop my skills in HTML. I started my introduction to web dev languages by doing Codecademy's courses in "HTML & CSS", "Creating a Website", as well as a Lynda course about Bootstrap to establish a foundation in these languages. </p>


              <p class = "text-left">
              After I completed those, I tried to start coding everything by hand. Unfortunately, it was a lot more complicated than I originally thought because of all of the formatting required for the website to work on all of the difference devices that exist today. So, I decided to look for a template that I could use to make that a bit easier. <a href = "https://bootstrapmade.com/demo/Baker/" > This theme </a>is the one I decided upon because I liked the design and color scheme. Now, it is basically unrecognizable because of all of the changes that I made to it. The original theme was only one page, but I changed it to be a multi-page site.
              </p>

              <p class = "text-left">
              After selecting the theme and learning the basics, I was finally able to start work on the website. Most of the content was completed because of what I had done for the class assignment, so I had to figure out what I wanted it to look like and execute that. It was frustrating at times to get everything to look the way I wanted, but I enjoyed it because one of my favorite aspects of programming is the creativity required. 
              </p>


              <p class = "text-left">
              Another skill I wanted to practice during this project was version control using GitHub. I had used GitHub for only one project in the past, and wasn't very adept at using it. I completed an online course, and was able to use it to help keep track of the many files needed to make this site. I was glad that I used a "dev" branch so that I had a backup of a working program in the master. Now, all of the code for this project is online in a <a href = "https://github.com/alyssajotice/alyssajotice.github.io" > repository</a> and is easy to look at or edit. 
              </p>

              <p class = "text-left">
              The hardest part of the project was getting all of the pages to work together and link correctly. I ended up making separeate CSS Style files for each web page so that the formatting could be unique for each page or for whatever element I needed. The last step of the project was putting it onto the web. I used the domain service NameCheap because they offer a free domain for a year for students. I linked my GitHub page with the code to my domain, and now it is online!
